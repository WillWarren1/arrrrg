My capstone is an ARG, or Augmented Reality Game, that helps players discover the thrill of piracy and questing for secret treasures on the high seas. In this game, players will travel great distances, both in and out of game, in order to collect rewards. Each time you log in to the game, it marks your location and populates the area around you with treasure chests. Players will also be encouraged to hide their own treasures for others to find in order to raise their pirateâ€™s reputation which allows them to find even greater treasures.
